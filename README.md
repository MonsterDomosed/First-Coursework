Develop an algorithm and write a program to play "Battleship" in a text console. 
The initial map and the designations of squares are set in a text file. An empty map is shown to the user (player). 
The player enters the coordinates of a square, after which his map should show a hit or miss.  
A "scoreboard" should be generated.
